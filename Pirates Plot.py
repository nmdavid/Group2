~~~~ The Pirates of the approximate Atlantic and the curse of the ancient artefacts ~~~~

You play as an escaped pirate's slave, who uncovers a letter from the legendary Pirate
Hack Narrow himself, detailing the existence of six ancient, invaluable artefacts
which all guide one to the decades old horde of treasure belonging to Hack himself. You
adventure out alone on your single-man sailing vessel to uncover these written secrets.

Waking up on the shore of a lonely island, you barely retain the memories of your escape
from the cruel pirate prison. As you look to your new surroundings, you see the
lifeless bodies of two of your companions. Mourning their loss, you decide to give them a
true burial. As you drag one body through the sand a bottle containing some
battered parchment falls from his pocket. you uncork the bottle and read the letter inside.

    |    Far across the crystal waves scattered are artefacts          |

Artefact 1 - (an inscribed golden coin) It's an old gold coin. Very old, and solid gold...
its value has no number that is for sure. The inscribed picture is (enter location
clue for next artefact)

Artefact 2 - (An ancient Greek pot) This pot details the story of Perseus and medusa, an
old Ancient Greek mythological story. On the bottom is a ragged engraving, much newer in
age. (enter location of next artefact)

Artefact 3 - (A leatherbound sailors Journal) This is a navigator's rutter. A logbook of
directions, locations, maps and most importantly, directions to specific areas of the deadly
ocean. (contains directions to artefact 4)

Artefact 4 - (A standard battered flintlock pistol) This pistol is common amongst pirates and
lawmen alike, containing a single shot. Seeing the unique leather wrapped handle reminds you
of the owner, a friend from a life almost forgotten living in (enter location).

Artefact 5 - (A silver ring) When you travel to find the old friend whose pistol you found,
you discover he has retired to become a simple shop keep, who claims to know Hack Narrow,
or at least he did... a long time ago. He gives you a silver ring for your travels. On the
inside are inscribed co-ordinates (to the next artefact).

Artefact 6 - The final artefact is held in a small museum in a quiet harbour town. You go
inside, and instantly one modest exhibit catches your eye. It is the figurehead piece of
the famed ship, Silver Sword. It is a solid silver model of a swordfish, with huge
polished rubies for eyes. The item itself is immensely valuable, held behind thick glass
and guarded by two armed men. It seems somewhat out of place. You read the plaque in front
of the exhibit. "The silver figurehead of the famed ship belonged to wealthy Spanish
businessman Carlos Buendia... of course before it was stolen from him by the enigmatic
band of pirates known as the black mist, and handed as a prize to their captain and leader
Garton 'No-Tongue' Crawford. It remained in his possession until death until it was passed
into the possession of his equally infamous but outcast son, Hack Narrow. It was in his
period of possession where the ship was disassembled, the parts used to create some kind
of storage room at a secret location, save this figurehead, donated to this museum."
Shouting comes from outside the building, growing louder and louder until silenced with
the crack of gunfire. The guards rush out to investigate. You remove your acquired pistol
from your jacket pocket, and use the single shot to shatter the glass surrounding the
figurehead. Apparently unnoticed due to the outside disturbance, you carefully remove the
left ruby eye of the figurehead and search for an exit through the back of the museum. As
you walk away, you hear a group of men discussing something as they shuffle past the limp
bodies of the guards into the museum.

You decide to travel away from the port. (after a certain number of moves, an event
triggers automatically, no matter where you are on the map.

THE EVENT - You are sailing through calm seas and blue skies, the wind is present but not
strong. It is peaceful. You decide to look at the ruby eye, and see that it catches
the sunlight in a very unique manner. as you angle it differently, you see that it's
when pointed towards the ocean, the light casts red onto the waves. The next second a wave
hits and it's gone. You try find the same spot again, and find that it is a trail of red
being lit up by the ruby's reflection. You change the sails and follow the path, the
ruby lighting the way. The path finishes leading you into the mouth of a cave set just off
a crag of rocks. Your boat fits inside just, and not too far in, you find a short wooden
mooring dock. You step onto the rocky shore, following the tunnel into the cavern deeper.
After a short walk on wet rock, the walls and ceilings of the tunnel start to widen, and
the light seeping through small gaps in the rocks overhead reveal a small wooden door
just ahead. On the door is a small hole. A slot... a lock. It fits the shape of the ruby
perfectly as you push it into place and the door swings open. Revealed is a vast, high
ceilinged wooden structure, small windows of light keeping the contents barely visible.
What was visible, however, was a huge array of varied treasures, crowding the room entirely.
The room was filled to the wooden bowed ceilings by the golden, silver, crystal treasured
all piled together. A voice suddenly materialised from behind you, "So you found me, then".
